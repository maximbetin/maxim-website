            Ever since I started indulging myself in DevOps, I decided that's
            where I want to stay in, and thus I want to learn as much as
            possible on System Administration and Scripting. Cloud Computing is
            something I took an interest in also – allowing developers to focus
            on creating applications and eliminating anything that strays away
            from it is a nifty concept. I currently have
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>
            relatively checked, but I do want to foster other Cloud providers
            such as
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a>
            and
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a>.
            Aside from that, I would also like to obtain the C2 (CPE)
            qualification in English (currently I own the C1 or CAE
            qualification in English), as I am open to travelling outside Spain
            such as the US or Canada, which are countries that I have a strong
            resemblance with and I think I could put this skill to the fullest
            use. Within Europe, Germany, Switzerland the UK and Ireland are some
            of my inclinations.

            Continuing my learning path in DevOps I decided to move on to new
            challenges and also learn a new Cloud provider -

            group - a Swiss Software company which surprised me as to how well
            they fit me in every single aspect I can think of. I started by
            scripting and automating internal processes using Python and
            PowerShell in order to reduce workloads and human errors, for which
            I used GitLab CI/CD pipelines with the intent of migrating the code
            to Kubernetes (AKS). Providing IT support to the rest of the company
            is a very important aspect of my role, and thus I'm also involved in
            it thanks to my time spent working for Google Cloud Platform. On
            another note, I wanted to move back to a big city from Alicante and
            therefore Flowable fit my desire quite well - having an office in
            Valencia.

            During my stay in Barcelona, I had a growing concern in the back of
            my head in regards to not having finished one subject in my Computer
            Engineering degree, namely
            <a
              href="https://cvnet.cpd.ua.es/Guia-Docente/?wlengua=en&wcodasi=34027&scaca=2020-21"
              >SSPT</a
            >. I decided to leave Barcelona to get that matter settled with in
            Alicante (and I did), with plans of coming back. To my misfortune
            (and everyone's really) the world decided it was time to spread a
            pandemic, and long story short, I could not return in May.
            Fortunately enough, I used the summer time to get
            <a
              href="https://www.credential.net/828e8f35-dfeb-4335-819d-0ac651ad5c7f"

            >
            in Google Cloud Platform, create this website, and consider what
            professional course to take next. I was looking for something that
            had some sort of Programming, Technical Support and Cloud Computing
            mixed in - things that I worked with in the past, and hence, DevOps
            appeared in my Google search. While staying in Alicante I found and
            joined <a href="https://www.planetahuerto.es/">Planeta Huerto</a> -
            an e-commerce company that sells environmentally friendly products
            in Spain and Portugal. And henceforth, I was officially sold on the
            DevOps concept and started dealing with and learning a lot about
            Kubernetes, Docker, System Administration, CI/CD, IaC, Monitoring
            and Logging, Incident Management, Agile Methodologies, etc. Planeta
            Huerto coincidentally used both PHP and Vue.js - the two web
            technologies I also used in the past so they captured my attention.

            exponentially. I learned a lot about the Cloud services major
            companies such as Google provide, especially the ones related to
            Serverless, Database and Storage, and how they can interact with
            each other. I touched upon multiple programming languages including
            Java, Python, Node.js, PHP and Go; relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
            Microsoft SQL Server) and non-relational databases; I extensively
            used different Internet protocols: HTTP(S), DNS, TLS/SSL, TCP, UDP,
            SMTP, SSH, TCP/IP, etc.; APIs such as REST; authentication standards
            such as OAuth; version control systems such as Git and a very heavy
            emphasis on Bash/Shell and the Linux/Unix operative systems. I also
            learned about and started experimenting with containerization
            systems such as Docker and Kubernetes. I was mainly tasked with
            troubleshooting anything related with the aforementioned points,
            engaging with English-speaking customers of GCP from all over the

            naturally, these were my initial prospects, Computer Engineering was
            on the horizon as well, but I wouldn’t finally decide until a few
            years later. The
